{{/*
    Eval Shortcode

    Executes the inner content as a Go template.
    This allows dynamic logic (like partials, variables, or functions) to be used
    directly inside a Markdown file.

    Flow:
    1. Hashing: Generates a unique filename based on content hash.
    2. Resource Creation: Creates a Hugo resource from the string.
    3. Execution: Executes the resource as a template with the current Page context.
    4. Output: Renders the result as safe HTML.

    Note: Use with caution as this allows arbitrary template execution.
